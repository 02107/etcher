This document aims to\nserve as a friendly guide for making your first contribution.\n\nHigh-level Etcher overview\n--------------------------\n\nMake sure you checkout our [ARCHITECTURE.md][ARCHITECTURE] guide, which aims to\nexplain how all the pieces fit together.\n\nDeveloping\n----------\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n#### Common\n\n- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (at least v6.11)\n- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org)\n- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)\n- [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)\n- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6.7)\n\n```sh\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nYou might need to run this with `sudo` or administrator permissions.\n\n#### Windows\n\n- [NSIS v2.51](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) (v3.x won't work)\n- Either one of the following:\n  - [Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) containing standalone compilers, libraries and scripts\n  - Install the [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) via npm with `npm install --global windows-build-tools`\n  - [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48146) (free) (other editions, like Professional and Enterprise, should work too)\n    **NOTE:** Visual Studio 2015 doesn't install C++ by default. You have to rerun the\n    setup, select \"Modify\" and then check `Visual C++ -> Common Tools for Visual\n    C++ 2015` (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/31955339)\n- [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org)\n\nYou might need to `npm config set msvs_version 2015` for node-gyp to correctly detect\nthe version of Visual Studio you're using (in this example VS2015).\n\nThe following MinGW packages are required:\n\n- `msys-make`\n- `msys-unzip`\n- `msys-zip`\n- `msys-bash`\n- `msys-coreutils`\n\n#### macOS\n\n- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)\n\nIt's not enough to have [Xcode Command Line Tools] installed. Xcode must be installed\nas well.\n\n#### Linux\n\n- `libudev-dev` for libusb (install with `sudo apt install libudev-dev` for example)\n\n### Cloning the project\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/balena-io/etcher\ncd etcher\n```\n\n### Installing npm dependencies\n\n**NOTE:** Please make use of the following command to install npm dependencies rather\nthan simply running `npm install` given that we need to do extra configuration\nto make sure native dependencies are correctly compiled for Electron, otherwise\nthe application might not run successfully.\n\nIf you're on Windows, **run the command from the _Developer Command Prompt for\nVS2015_**, to ensure all Visual Studio command utilities are available in the\n`%PATH%`.\n\n```sh\nmake electron-develop\n```\n\n### Running the application\n\n#### GUI\n\n```sh\n# Build the GUI\nmake webpack\n# Start Electron\nnpm start\n```\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTo run the test suite, run the following command:\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\nGiven the nature of this application, not everything can be unit tested. For\nexample:\n\n- The writing operating on real raw devices.\n- Platform inconsistencies.\n- Style changes.\n- Artwork.\n\nWe encourage our contributors to test the application on as many operating\nsystems as they can before sending a pull request.\n\n*The test suite is run automatically by CI servers when you send a pull\nrequest.*\n\nWe also rely on various `make` targets to perform some common tasks:\n\n- `make lint`: Run the linter.\n- `make sass`: Compile SCSS files.\n\nWe make use of [EditorConfig] to communicate indentation, line endings and\nother text editing default. We encourage you to install the relevant plugin in\nyour text editor of choice to avoid having to fix any issues during the review\nprocess.\n\nUpdating a dependency\n---------------------\n\nGiven we use [npm shrinkwrap][shrinkwrap], we have to take extra steps to make\nsure the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file gets updated correctly when we update a\ndependency.\n\nUse the following steps to ensure everything goes flawlessly:\n\n- Run `make electron-develop` to ensure you don't have extraneous dependencies\n  you might have brought during development, or you are running older\n  dependencies because you come from another branch or reference.\n\n- Install the new version of the dependency. For example: `npm install --save\n  <package>@<version>`. This will update the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file.\n\n- Commit *both* `package.json` and `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.\n\nDiffing Binaries\n----------------\n\nBinary files are tagged as \"binary\" in the `.gitattributes` file, but also have\na `diff=hex` tag, which allows you to see hexdump-style diffs for binaries,\nif you add the following to either your global or repository-local git config:\n\n```sh\n$ git config diff.hex.textconv hexdump\n$ git config diff.hex.binary true\n```\n\nAnd global, respectively:\n\n```sh\n$ git config --global diff.hex.textconv hexdump\n$ git config --global diff.hex.binary true\n```\n\nIf you don't have `hexdump` available on your platform,\nyou can try [hxd], which is also a bit faster.\n\nCommit Guidelines\n-----------------\n\nSee [COMMIT-GUIDELINES.md][COMMIT-GUIDELINES] for a thorough guide on how to\nwrite commit messages.\n\nSending a pull request\n----------------------\n\nWhen sending a pull request, consider the following guidelines:\n\n- Write a concise commit message explaining your changes.\n\n- If applies, write more descriptive information in the commit body.\n\n- Mention the operating systems with the corresponding versions in which you\ntested your changes.\n\n- If your change affects the visuals of the application, consider attaching a\nscreenshot.\n\n- Refer to the issue/s your pull request fixes, so they're closed automatically\nwhen your pull request is merged.\n\n- Write a descriptive pull request title.\n\n- Squash commits when possible, for example, when committing review changes.\n\nBefore your pull request can be merged, the following conditions must hold:\n\n- The linter doesn't throw any warning.\n\n- All the tests pass.\n\n- The coding style aligns with the project's convention.\n\n- Your changes are confirmed to be working in recent versions of the operating\nsystems we support.\n\nDon't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or need any help!\n\n[ARCHITECTURE]: https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/blob/master/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md\n[COMMIT-GUIDELINES]: https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/blob/master/docs/COMMIT-GUIDELINES.md\n[EditorConfig]: http://editorconfig.org\n[shrinkwrap]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap\n[hxd]: https://github.com/jhermsmeier/hxd\n[Xcode Command Line Tools]: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2339/_index.html\n","jsonml":[{"references":{"architecture":{"href":"https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/blob/master/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md"},"commit-guidelines":{"href":"https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/blob/master/docs/COMMIT-GUIDELINES.md"},"editorconfig":{"href":"http://editorconfig.org"},"shrinkwrap":{"href":"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap"},"hxd":{"href":"https://github.com/jhermsmeier/hxd"},"xcode command line tools":{"href":"https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2339/_index.html"}}},["header",{"level":1},"Contributing Guide"],["para","Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project!

The header has a\nspecial format that includes a type, a scope and a subject.\n\n```\n<type>(<scope>): <subject>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<body>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<footer>\n```\n\nThe subject should not contain more than 70 characters, including the type and\nscope, and the body should be wrapped at 72 characters.\n\nType\n----\n\nMust be one of the following:\n\n- `feat`: A new feature.\n- `fix`: A bug fix.\n- `minifix`: A minimal fix that doesn't warrant an entry in the CHANGELOG.\n- `docs`: Documentation only changes.\n- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space,\nformatting, missing semi-colons, JSDoc annotations, comments, etc).\n- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.\n- `perf`: A code change that improves performance.\n- `test`: Adding missing tests.\n- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries.\n- `upgrade`: A version upgrade of a project dependency.\n\nScope\n-----\n\nThe scope is required for types that make sense, such as `feat`, `fix`,\n`test`, etc. Certain commit types, such as `chore` might not have a clearly\ndefined scope, in which case its better to omit it.\n\nSubject\n-------\n\nThe subject should contain a short description of the change:\n\n- Use the imperative, present tense.\n- Don't capitalize the first letter.\n- No dot (.) at the end.\n\nFooter\n------\n\nThe footer contains extra information about the commit, such as tags.\n\n**Breaking Changes** should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space\nor two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.\n\nTags\n----\n\n### `See: <url>`/`Link: <url>`\n\nThis tag can be used to reference a resource that is relevant to the commit,\nand can be repeated multiple times in the same commit.\n\nResource examples include:\n\n- A link to pull requests.\n- A link to a GitHub issue.\n- A link to a website providing useful information.\n- A commit hash.\n\nIts recommended that you avoid relative URLs, and that you include the whole\ncommit hash to avoid any potential ambiguity issues in the future.\n\nIf the commit type equals `upgrade`, this tag should be present, and should\nlink to the CHANGELOG section of the dependency describing the changes\nintroduced from the previously used version.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nSee: https://github.com/xxx/yyy/\nSee: 49d89b4acebd80838303b011d30517cd6229fdbe\nLink: https://github.com/xxx/yyy/issues/zzz\n```\n\n### `Closes: <url>`/`Fixes: <url>`\n\nThis tag is used to make GitHub close the referenced issue automatically when\nthe commit is merged.\n\nIts recommended that you provide the absolute URL to the GitHub issue rather\nthan simply writing the ID prefixed by a hash tag for convenience when browsing\nthe commit history outside the GitHub web interface.\n\nA commit can include multiple instances of this tag.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nCloses: https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/issues/XXX\nFixes: https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/issues/XXX\n```\n\n### `Change-Type: <type>`\n\nThis tag is used to determine the change type that a commit introduces. The\nfollowing types are supported:\n\n- `major`\n- `minor`\n- `patch`\n\nThis tag can be omitted for commits that don't change the application from the\nuser's point of view, such as for refactoring commits.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nChange-Type: major\nChange-Type: minor\nChange-Type: patch\n```\n\nSee the [Semantic Versioning][semver] specification for a more detailed\nexplanation of the meaning of these types.\n\n### `Changelog-Entry: <message>`\n\nThis tag is used to describe the changes introduced by the commit in a more\nhuman style that would fit the `CHANGELOG.md` better.\n\nIf the commit type is either `fix` or `feat`, the commit will take part in the\nCHANGELOG. If this tag is not defined, then the commit subject will be used\ninstead.\n\nYou explicitly can use this tag to make a commit whose type is not `fix` nor\n`feat` appear in the `CHANGELOG.md`.\n\nSince whatever your write here will be shown *as it is* in the `CHANGELOG.md`,\ntake some time to write a decent entry. Consider the following guidelines:\n\n- Use the imperative, present tense.\n- Capitalize the first letter.\n\nThere is no fixed length limit for the contents of this tag, but always strive\nto make as short as possible without compromising its quality.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nChangelog-Entry: Fix EPERM errors when flashing to a GPT drive.\n```\n\nComplete examples\n-----------------\n\n```\nfix(GUI): ignore extensions before the first non-compressed extension\n\nCurrently, we extract all the extensions from an image path and report back\nthat the image is invalid if *any* of the extensions is not valid , however\nthis can cause trouble with images including information between dots that are\nnot strictly extensions, for example:\n\n    elementaryos-0.3.2-stable-i386.20151209.iso\n\nEtcher will consider `20151209` to be an invalid extension and therefore\nwill prevent such image from being selected at all.\n\nAs a way to allow these corner cases but still make use of our enforced check\ncontrols, the validation routine now only consider extensions starting from the\nfirst non compressed extension.\n\nChange-Type: patch\nChangelog-Entry: Don't interpret image file name information between dots as image extensions.\nFixes: https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/issues/492\n```\n\n***\n\n```\nupgrade: etcher-image-write to v5.0.2\n\nThis version contains a fix to an `EPERM` issue happening to some Windows user,\ntriggered by the `write` system call during the first ~5% of a flash given that\nthe operating system still thinks the drive has a file system.\n\nChange-Type: patch\nChangelog-Entry: Upgrade `etcher-image-write` to v5.0.2.\nLink: https://github.com/balena-io-modules/etcher-image-write/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#502---2016-06-27\nFixes: https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/issues/531\n```\n\n***\n\n```\nfeat(GUI): implement update notifier functionality\n\nAuto-update functionality is not ready for usage.

This document aims to\nserve as a friendly guide for making your first contribution.\n\nHigh-level Etcher overview\n--------------------------\n\nMake sure you checkout our [ARCHITECTURE.md][ARCHITECTURE] guide, which aims to\nexplain how all the pieces fit together.\n\nDeveloping\n----------\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n#### Common\n\n- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (at least v6.11)\n- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org)\n- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)\n- [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)\n- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6.7)\n\n```sh\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nYou might need to run this with `sudo` or administrator permissions.\n\n#### Windows\n\n- [NSIS v2.51](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) (v3.x won't work)\n- Either one of the following:\n  - [Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) containing standalone compilers, libraries and scripts\n  - Install the [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) via npm with `npm install --global windows-build-tools`\n  - [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48146) (free) (other editions, like Professional and Enterprise, should work too)\n    **NOTE:** Visual Studio 2015 doesn't install C++ by default. You have to rerun the\n    setup, select \"Modify\" and then check `Visual C++ -> Common Tools for Visual\n    C++ 2015` (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/31955339)\n- [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org)\n\nYou might need to `npm config set msvs_version 2015` for node-gyp to correctly detect\nthe version of Visual Studio you're using (in this example VS2015).\n\nThe following MinGW packages are required:\n\n- `msys-make`\n- `msys-unzip`\n- `msys-zip`\n- `msys-bash`\n- `msys-coreutils`\n\n#### macOS\n\n- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)\n\nIt's not enough to have [Xcode Command Line Tools] installed. Xcode must be installed\nas well.\n\n#### Linux\n\n- `libudev-dev` for libusb (install with `sudo apt install libudev-dev` for example)\n\n### Cloning the project\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/balena-io/etcher\ncd etcher\n```\n\n### Installing npm dependencies\n\n**NOTE:** Please make use of the following command to install npm dependencies rather\nthan simply running `npm install` given that we need to do extra configuration\nto make sure native dependencies are correctly compiled for Electron, otherwise\nthe application might not run successfully.\n\nIf you're on Windows, **run the command from the _Developer Command Prompt for\nVS2015_**, to ensure all Visual Studio command utilities are available in the\n`%PATH%`.\n\n```sh\nmake electron-develop\n```\n\n### Running the application\n\n#### GUI\n\n```sh\n# Build the GUI\nmake webpack\n# Start Electron\nnpm start\n```\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTo run the test suite, run the following command:\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\nGiven the nature of this application, not everything can be unit tested. For\nexample:\n\n- The writing operating on real raw devices.\n- Platform inconsistencies.\n- Style changes.\n- Artwork.\n\nWe encourage our contributors to test the application on as many operating\nsystems as they can before sending a pull request.\n\n*The test suite is run automatically by CI servers when you send a pull\nrequest.*\n\nWe also rely on various `make` targets to perform some common tasks:\n\n- `make lint`: Run the linter.\n- `make sass`: Compile SCSS files.\n\nWe make use of [EditorConfig] to communicate indentation, line endings and\nother text editing default. We encourage you to install the relevant plugin in\nyour text editor of choice to avoid having to fix any issues during the review\nprocess.\n\nUpdating a dependency\n---------------------\n\nGiven we use [npm shrinkwrap][shrinkwrap], we have to take extra steps to make\nsure the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file gets updated correctly when we update a\ndependency.\n\nUse the following steps to ensure everything goes flawlessly:\n\n- Run `make electron-develop` to ensure you don't have extraneous dependencies\n  you might have brought during development, or you are running older\n  dependencies because you come from another branch or reference.\n\n- Install the new version of the dependency. For example: `npm install --save\n  <package>@<version>`. This will update the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file.\n\n- Commit *both* `package.json` and `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.\n\nDiffing Binaries\n----------------\n\nBinary files are tagged as \"binary\" in the `.gitattributes` file, but also have\na `diff=hex` tag, which allows you to see hexdump-style diffs for binaries,\nif you add the following to either your global or repository-local git config:\n\n```sh\n$ git config diff.hex.textconv hexdump\n$ git config diff.hex.binary true\n```\n\nAnd global, respectively:\n\n```sh\n$ git config --global diff.hex.textconv hexdump\n$ git config --global diff.hex.binary true\n```\n\nIf you don't have `hexdump` available on your platform,\nyou can try [hxd], which is also a bit faster.\n\nCommit Guidelines\n-----------------\n\nSee [COMMIT-GUIDELINES.md][COMMIT-GUIDELINES] for a thorough guide on how to\nwrite commit messages.\n\nSending a pull request\n----------------------\n\nWhen sending a pull request, consider the following guidelines:\n\n- Write a concise commit message explaining your changes.\n\n- If applies, write more descriptive information in the commit body.\n\n- Mention the operating systems with the corresponding versions in which you\ntested your changes.\n\n- If your change affects the visuals of the application, consider attaching a\nscreenshot.\n\n- Refer to the issue/s your pull request fixes, so they're closed automatically\nwhen your pull request is merged.\n\n- Write a descriptive pull request title.\n\n- Squash commits when possible, for example, when committing review changes.\n\nBefore your pull request can be merged, the following conditions must hold:\n\n- The linter doesn't throw any warning.\n\n- All the tests pass.\n\n- The coding style aligns with the project's convention.\n\n- Your changes are confirmed to be working in recent versions of the operating\nsystems we support.\n\nDon't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or need any help!\n\n[ARCHITECTURE]: https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/blob/master/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md\n[COMMIT-GUIDELINES]: https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/blob/master/docs/COMMIT-GUIDELINES.md\n[EditorConfig]: http://editorconfig.org\n[shrinkwrap]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap\n[hxd]: https://github.com/jhermsmeier/hxd\n[Xcode Command Line Tools]: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2339/_index.html\n","jsonml":[{"references":{"architecture":{"href":"https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/blob/master/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md"},"commit-guidelines":{"href":"https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/blob/master/docs/COMMIT-GUIDELINES.md"},"editorconfig":{"href":"http://editorconfig.org"},"shrinkwrap":{"href":"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap"},"hxd":{"href":"https://github.com/jhermsmeier/hxd"},"xcode command line tools":{"href":"https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2339/_index.html"}}},["header",{"level":1},"Contributing Guide"],["para","Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project!

Each is\npublished to a different S3 bucket, and production release types are code\nsigned, while snapshot release types aren't and include a short git commit-hash\nas a build number. For example, `1.0.0-beta.19` is a production release type,\nwhile `1.0.0-beta.19+531ab82` is a snapshot release type.\n\nIn terms of comparison: `1.0.0-beta.19` (production) < `1.0.0-beta.19+531ab82`\n(snapshot) < `1.0.0-rc.1` (production) < `1.0.0-rc.1+7fde24a` (snapshot) <\n`1.0.0` (production) < `1.0.0+2201e5f` (snapshot). Keep in mind that if you're\nrunning a production release type, you'll only be prompted to update to\nproduction release types, and if you're running a snapshot release type, you'll\nonly be prompted to update to other snapshot release types.\n\nThe build system creates (and publishes) snapshot release types by default, but\nyou can build a specific release type by setting the `RELEASE_TYPE` make\nvariable.  For example:\n\n```sh\nmake <target> RELEASE_TYPE=snapshot\nmake <target> RELEASE_TYPE=production\n```\n\nWe can control the version range a specific Etcher version will consider when\nshowing the update notification dialog by tweaking the `updates.semverRange`\nproperty of `package.json`.\n\nUpdate Channels\n---------------\n\nEtcher has a setting to include the unstable update channel. If this option is\nset, Etcher will consider both stable and unstable versions when showing the\nupdate notifier dialog. Unstable versions are the ones that contain a `beta`\npre-release tag. For example:\n\n- Production unstable version: `1.4.0-beta.1`\n- Snapshot unstable version: `1.4.0-beta.1+7fde24a`\n- Production stable version: `1.4.0`\n- Snapshot stable version: `1.4.0+7fde24a`\n\nSigning\n-------\n\n### OS X\n\n1. Get our Apple Developer ID certificate for signing applications distributed\noutside the Mac App Store from the balena.io Apple account.\n\n2. Install the Developer ID certificate to your Mac's Keychain by double\nclicking on the certificate file.\n\nThe application will be signed automatically using this certificate when\npackaging for OS X.\n\n### Windows\n\n1. Get access to our code signing certificate and decryption key as a balena.io\nemployee by asking for it from the relevant people.\n\n2. Place the certificate in the root of the Etcher repository naming it\n`certificate.p12`.\n\nPackaging\n---------\n\nThe resulting installers will be saved to `dist/out`.\n\nRun the following commands:\n\n### OS X\n\n```sh\nmake electron-installer-dmg\nmake electron-installer-app-zip\n```\n\n### GNU/Linux\n\n```sh\nmake electron-installer-appimage\nmake electron-installer-debian\n```\n\n### Windows\n\n```sh\nmake electron-installer-zip\nmake electron-installer-nsis\n```\n\nPublishing to Bintray\n---------------------\n\nWe publish GNU/Linux Debian packages to [Bintray][bintray].\n\nMake sure you set the following environment variables:\n\n- `BINTRAY_USER`\n- `BINTRAY_API_KEY`\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```sh\nmake publish-bintray-debian\n```\n\nPublishing to S3\n----------------\n\n- [AWS CLI][aws-cli]\n\nMake sure you have the [AWS CLI tool][aws-cli] installed and configured to\naccess balena.io's production or snapshot S3 bucket.\n\nRun the following command to publish all files for the current combination of\n_platform_ and _arch_ (building them if necessary):\n\n```sh\nmake publish-aws-s3\n```\n\nAlso add links to each AWS S3 file in [GitHub Releases][github-releases].

In these\ncases, the general advice is to use software specific to those kind of\nimages, usually available from the image publishers themselves.\n\nImages known to require special treatment:\n\n- Microsoft Windows (use [Windows USB/DVD Download Tool][windows-usb-tool], \n  [Rufus][rufus], or [WoeUSB][woeusb]).\n\n- Windows 10 IoT (use the [Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard][windows-iot-dashboard])\n\nHow can I configure persistent storage?\n---------------------------------------\n\nSome programs, usually oriented at making GNU/Linux live USB drives, include an\noption to set persistent storage. This is currently not supported by Etcher, so\nif you require this functionality, we advise to fallback to\n[UNetbootin][unetbootin].\n\nDeactivate desktop shortcut prompt on GNU/Linux\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a feature provided by [AppImages][appimage], where the applications\nprompts the user to automatically register a desktop shortcut to easily access\nthe application.\n\nTo deactivate this feature, `touch` any of the files listed below:\n\n- `$HOME/.local/share/appimagekit/no_desktopintegration`\n- `/usr/share/appimagekit/no_desktopintegration`\n- `/etc/appimagekit/no_desktopintegration`\n\nAlternatively, set the `SKIP` environment variable before executing the\nAppImage:\n\n```sh\nSKIP=1 ./Etcher-linux-<arch>.AppImage\n```\n\nFlashing Ubuntu ISOs\n--------------------\n\nUbuntu images (and potentially some other related GNU/Linux distributions) have\na peculiar format that allows the image to boot without any further\nmodification from both CDs and USB drives.\n\nA consequence of this enhancement is that some programs, like `parted` get\nconfused about the drive's format and partition table, printing warnings such\nas:\n\n> /dev/xxx contains GPT signatures, indicating that it has a GPT table.\n> However, it does not have a valid fake msdos partition table, as it should.\n> Perhaps it was corrupted -- possibly by a program that doesn't understand GPT\n> partition tables.  Or perhaps you deleted the GPT table, and are now using an\n> msdos partition table.  Is this a GPT partition table?  Both the primary and\n> backup GPT tables are corrupt.  Try making a fresh table, and using Parted's\n> rescue feature to recover partitions.\n\n***\n\n> Warning: The driver descriptor says the physical block size is 2048 bytes,\n> but Linux says it is 512 bytes.\n\nAll these warnings are **safe to ignore**, and your drive should be able to\nboot without any problems.\n\nRefer to [the following message from Ubuntu's mailing\nlist](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2011-June/033495.html) if\nyou want to learn more.\n\nRunning on Wayland\n------------------\n\nElectron is based on Gtk2, which can't run natively on Wayland. Fortunately,\nthe [XWayland Server][xwayland] provides backwards compatibility to run *any* X\nclient on Wayland, including Etcher.\n\nThis usually works out of the box on mainstream GNU/Linux distributions that\nproperly support Wayland. If it doesn't, make sure the `xwayland.so` module is\nbeing loaded by declaring it in your [weston.ini]:\n\n```\n[core]\nmodules=xwayland.so\n```\n\nRuntime GNU/Linux dependencies\n------------------------------\n\nThis entry aims to provide an up to date list of runtime dependencies needed to\nrun Etcher on a GNU/Linux system.\n\n### Electron specific\n\n> See [brightray's gyp file](https://github.com/electron/brightray/blob/master/brightray.gyp#L4)\n\n- gtk+-2.0\n- dbus-1\n- x11\n- xi\n- xcursor\n- xdamage\n- xrandr\n- xcomposite\n- xext\n- xfixes\n- xrender\n- xtst\n- xscrnsaver\n- gconf-2.0\n- gmodule-2.0\n- nss\n\n### Optional dependencies:\n\n- libnotify (for notifications)\n- libspeechd (for text-to-speech)\n\n### Etcher specific:\n\n- liblzma (for xz decompression)\n\nRecovering broken drives\n------------------------\n\nSometimes, things might go wrong, and you end up with a half-flashed drive that\nis unusable by your operating systems, and common graphical tools might even\nrefuse to get it back to a normal state.\n\nTo solve these kinds of problems, we've collected a list of fail-proof methods\nto completely erase your drive in major operating systems.\n\n### Windows\n\nIn Windows, we'll use [diskpart], a command line utility tool that comes\npre-installed in all modern Windows versions.\n\n- Open `cmd.exe` from either the list of all installed applications, or from\n  the \"Run...\" dialog usually accessible by pressing Ctrl+X.\n\n- Type `diskpart.exe` and press \"Enter\". You'll be asked to provide\n  administrator permissions, and a new prompt window will appear. The following\n  commands should be run **in the new window**.\n\n- Run `list disk` to list the available drives. Take note of the number id that\n  identifies the drive you want to clean.\n\n- Run `select disk N`, where `N` corresponds to the id from the previous step.\n\n- Run `clean`. This command will completely clean your drive by erasing any\n  existent filesystem.\n\n### OS X\n\nRun the following command in `Terminal.app`, replacing `N` by the corresponding\ndisk number, which you can find by running `diskutil list`:\n\n```sh\ndiskutil eraseDisk free UNTITLED /dev/diskN\n```\n\n### GNU/Linux\n\nMake sure the drive is unmounted (`umount /dev/xxx`), and run the following\ncommand as `root`, replacing `xxx` by your actual device path:\n\n```sh\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/xxx bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc\n```\n\n\"No polkit authentication agent found\" error in GNU/Linux\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEtcher requires an available [polkit authentication\nagent](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Polkit#Authentication_agents) in\nyour system in order to show a secure password prompt dialog to perform\nelevation. Make sure you have one installed for the desktop environment of your\nchoice.\n\nRunning in older macOS versions\n-------------------------------\n\nEtcher GUI is based on the [Electron][electron] framework, [which only supports\nmacOS 10.10 (Yosemite) and newer versions][electron-supported-platforms].\n\n[balena.io]: https://balena.io\n[appimage]: http://appimage.org\n[xwayland]: https://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html\n[weston.ini]: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/man5/weston.ini.5.html\n[diskpart]: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770877(v=ws.11).aspx\n[electron]: https://electronjs.org/\n[electron-supported-platforms]: https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#supported-platforms\n[publishing]: https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/blob/master/docs/PUBLISHING.md\n[windows-usb-tool]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool\n[rufus]: https://rufus.akeo.ie\n[unetbootin]: https://unetbootin.github.io\n[windows-iot-dashboard]: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/downloads\n[woeusb]: https://github.com/slacka/WoeUSB\n","jsonml":[{"references":{"balena.io":{"href":"https://balena.io"},"appimage":{"href":"http://appimage.org"},"xwayland":{"href":"https://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html"},"weston.ini":{"href":"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/man5/weston.ini.5.html"},"diskpart":{"href":"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770877(v=ws.11).aspx"},"electron":{"href":"https://electronjs.org/"},"electron-supported-platforms":{"href":"https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#supported-platforms"},"publishing":{"href":"https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/blob/master/docs/PUBLISHING.md"},"windows-usb-tool":{"href":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool"},"rufus":{"href":"https://rufus.akeo.ie"},"unetbootin":{"href":"https://unetbootin.github.io"},"windows-iot-dashboard":{"href":"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/downloads"},"woeusb":{"href":"https://github.com/slacka/WoeUSB"}}},["header",{"level":1},"Etcher User Documentation"],["para","This document contains how-tos and FAQs oriented to Etcher users."],["header",{"level":2},"Why is my drive not bootable?"],["para","Etcher copies images to drives byte by byte, without doing any transformation\nto the final device, which means images that require special treatment to be\nmade bootable, like Windows images, will not work out of the box.
